## Hey!

Welcome the LCES development team!

The team is currently led by [storcale](https://github.com/storcale) and composed of two other members: Frapritzy and filipoMC.

We create tools for the medical and fire emergency services of the River City Roleplay server.
A large number of tools made for this community can be found at https://github.com/storcale, such as the LCFR API.
